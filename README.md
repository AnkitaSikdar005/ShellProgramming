# Operating Systems Lab (PCC-CS592)üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

## Overview
This repository contains lab assignments for the Operating Systems course (PCC-CS592) offered by the Department of Information Technology at Netaji Subhash Engineering College. The exercises cover various aspects of operating systems, including UNIX commands, shell programming, process management, signals, semaphores, POSIX threads, and inter-process communication.

## Lab Contents

### 1. UNIX Commands & Applications
- **Introduction to UNIX OS:** Basics of the UNIX operating system, including the file system, types of files, users, access permissions, shell, and kernel.
- **UNIX Commands:** Examples include `cal`, `date`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `cd`, `rmdir`, `ls`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `wc`, `uname`, `man`, `who`, `echo`, `more`, `chmod`, etc.

### 2. Shell Programming: User Input and Conditional Branching
- **Examples:**
  - Find the largest among three numbers.
  - Find the second highest number.
  - Determine if a number is even or odd.
  - Check if a year is a leap year.

### 3. Shell Programming: Loop and Switch Case
- **Menu-driven Scripts:**
  - Arithmetic operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).
  - Display current folder contents, present working directory, calendar of the current month.
  - File operations: Copy, Remove, Move, Rename.
  - Loop-based tasks: Print natural numbers, calculate factorial, check for prime numbers.
  - Pattern printing with nested loops.

### 4. Shell Programming: Functions, Command Line Arguments, and Arrays
- **Examples:**
  - Sum of digits using command line arguments and functions.
  - Reverse a number using command line arguments.
  - Prime number check using command line arguments.
  - Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort) implemented in shell scripts.

### 5. Programming: Process
- **Process Concepts:** Examples include background processes, parent/child processes, zombie, orphan, sleeping, and running processes.

### 6. Programming: Signal
- **Signal Handling:** Programs to manage and reset signals like SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGHUP.

### 7. Programming: Semaphore
- **Semaphore Operations:** Examples include semaphore creation, limitations, and usage.

### 8. Programming: POSIX Threads
- **Thread Management:** Programs to create and manage threads using the pthread library.

### 9. Programming: Inter-process Communication
- **Pipe Operations:** Examples include creating pipes, determining maximum pipes, one-way communication, and implementing named pipes.

### Optional Practice Programs
- **Algorithm Implementations:** Compare performances of various scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority-based), deadlock avoidance (Banker‚Äôs Algorithm), page replacement (FIFO, LRU), and disk scheduling (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN).
